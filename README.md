# ⚽ Football Match Predictor

A machine learning project that predicts the outcomes of football matches.  
It uses a **Random Forest Classifier** trained on historical match data to make data-driven predictions.  
The project includes a full pipeline for data preparation, model training, and prediction generation.

---

## ✨ Features
- **End-to-end pipeline**: From raw data input to final, formatted predictions.  
- **Automated model tuning**: `RandomizedSearchCV` finds the best hyperparameters.  
- **Comprehensive feature engineering**: 18 features including goal differences, vote counts, and prediction variance.  
- **Two prediction methods**:  
  - Machine learning-based predictor  
  - Pattern-matching predictor  
- **User-friendly output**: Predictions exported to Excel with color-coding.

## 📦 Prerequisites
- **Python 3.x**  
- Install dependencies:  
```bash
pip install pandas openpyxl scikit-learn joblib matplotlib seaborn tqdm
```

## 🔄 Project Workflow

### 1️⃣ Training the Model (run only when new historical data is added)

#### Step 1: Prepare the dataset
```bash
python prepare_predictions.py
```
Processes `RawPrediction.xlsx` → creates `enhanced_dataset.csv`.

#### Step 2: Create the scaler
```bash
python create_scaler.py
```
Fits a scaler and saves `scaler.pkl`.

#### Step 3: Train the model
```bash
python train_model.py
```
- Performs hyperparameter tuning  
- Saves model → `football_model_optimized.pkl`  
- Saves evaluation → `model_evaluation.txt`

---

### 2️⃣ Making Predictions

#### Step 1: Add new matches → fill in `new_matches.xlsx`.

#### Step 2: Run predictor
```bash
python predict_matches.py
```
Exports results → `predicted_results.xlsx` (with color-coded outcomes).

---

### 3️⃣ Alternative Method: Pattern-based Prediction

#### Step 1: Ensure `new_matches.xlsx` is filled.

#### Step 2: Run pattern matcher
```bash
python pattern_predict.py
```
Exports results → `pattern_matches.xlsx`.

## 🚀 Future Improvements
- Automate data scraping (bypass Cloudflare).  
- Expand dataset across more leagues/seasons.  
- Try deep learning (e.g. LSTMs for sequence data).  
- Build a web dashboard for interactive predictions.
